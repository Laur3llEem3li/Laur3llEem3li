My name is Eemeli Laurell and I am a finnish student interested in IT 
and programming and whatever comes with computers.

I have been working on learning C++ and working with memory.
Lately I have been using my time learning IT security and learning exploits and how to do them.

I have a pretty broad understanding of computers I have done alot from video editing, photo editing, making simple games and trainers for games. I also know simple Assembly and simple reverse engineering, but constantly trying to learn more!

I know how to do simple diagnostics on computers so if it occurs that a customer or a co-worker needs help with their pc I can most likely help.

My best feat so far in my opinion has to be being able to replicate an exploit that was found in a game called Escape from tarkov where u would make a shader in unity and replacing a shader in the game files and matching the game file size to avoid detection by Eac giving u wallhacks.

Overall I am ready to learn and a fast learner so if u give me the chance to work with you and your company I will make it worth ur time.

Thank U for taking the time to read my about section.
