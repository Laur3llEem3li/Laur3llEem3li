# and Welcome to my profile! 😁


### My name is Eemeli Laurell and I am a finnish student interested in IT and programming and whatever comes with computers.

📖 I have been learning C++ and working with memory.
Recently I have been using free my time learning IT security and learning exploits and how to do them and       getting to know the linux workspace.😮

## Skills
 ✅ I have a pretty broad understanding of computers I have done alot from video editing, photo editing, making simple games and trainers for games. I also know simple Assembly and simple reverse engineering, but constantly trying to learn more!

💻 I know how to do simple diagnostics on computers so if it occurs that a customer or a co-worker needs help with   their pc I can most likely help.

## My latest projects

I made a script for a popular mmorpg called Growtopia, that automatically logs in multiple accounts and starts farming and breaking blocks automatically, not a hard project just a base I made so that in the future if I want to automate anything in the game I can do it.

Simple kernel based bunnyhop cheat for the game called cs:go which is undetected by vac(valve anticheat)❗

## Goals

- Getting into the working world in IT.
- Finishing up my school.
- To keep learning.

## Best feat
My best feat so far in my opinion has to be being able to replicate an exploit that was found in a game called Escape from tarkov where u would make a shader in unity and replacing a shader in the game files and matching the game file size to avoid detection by Eac giving u wallhacks.

## Overall
Overall I am well versed in the IT world and have alot of basic knowledge in IT. 
I am a fast learner and ready to put my own time into learning something new.

If you give me the chance to work with you and your company I will make it worth your time.

Thank you for taking the time to read my about section. 💜
